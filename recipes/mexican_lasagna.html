    <p><i>A plate of homemade Mexican lasagna. Mm-mm!</i></p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My family has been making this dish for longer than I've been alive. Not really Mexican <em>nor</em> truly lasagna, it sits in the strange middleground of both. It's delicious, albeit almost certainly not healthy for you.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 boxes of shell noodles</li>
        <lI>4 cups of shredded cheddar cheese</lI>
        <li>2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 large cans of chili (beans optional)</li>
        <li>Addons! Black olives go very well with this dish.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook shell noodles in boiling water.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 F</li>
        <li>In a baking pan lined with tinfoil, add ingredients. Layer them appropriately to create a faux-lasagna feel to them.</li>
        <li>Cook for forty minutes or until the top of the cheese begins to brown at the edges.</li>
    </ol>
