    <p><i>A delicious meal or snack.</i></p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Something that I stumbled upon while I was learning how to adapt my diet to a more vegetarian one, these black quesadillas are absolutely delightful. They go well as their own meal, but they work just as well as a compliment to something else due to their low calorie content.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div id="ingredients">
    <ul>
        <li>10 tortilla shells</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen corn</li>
        <li>1 can of black beans</li>
        <li>2 cups preferred shredded cheese</li>
        <li>1 packet of taco seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 cup red onion</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Drain the black beans and add them to a bowl with the frozen corn.</li>
        <li>Dice the onion and mince the garlic.</li>
        <li>Add onion, garlic, taco seasoning, and shredded cheese to the bowl containing the black beans and frozen corn. Stir evenly.</li>
        <li>Add a half cup of the filling to one side of the tortilla and fold over. Cook the quesadillas over the oven on medium heat until each side is golden brown and the cheese has melted.</li>
    </ol>
